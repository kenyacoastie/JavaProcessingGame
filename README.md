I just learned how to code in Java 4 days ago. SO LET'S MAKE A GAME!

    - Installation instructions
    
#### Development Process
    - Your process/approach.
    - Unsolved problems.
    - Your biggest wins and challenges. Challenge was getting the different classes to synchronize and communicate. Turned main app into a router & source of truth. 
    - A five-slide presentation, to be given in front of classmates, outlining the following points:
    - Space shooter. 
    - The rules of the game. Shoot oncoming asteroids to beat high scores.
    - Your process for turning that game into a web application (wireframes, blockers/issues that popped up).
    - Screenshots of actual game play.
    - Screenshots of the snippets of code you used to solve particularly interesting problems (think code highlights)
    - Bonus:
    - Store game history across sessions
